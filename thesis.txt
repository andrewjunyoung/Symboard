So, a person will have to know *something* about the language they're trying to type. But we want it to be really easy to start typing in any language, with minimal learning.

There are basically 3 ways to do this:
1. Place charecters where other similar scripts place graphically similar characters
2. Make users memorize 1 romanization system for each script, and type each script by using its particular romanization
3. Make users remember 1 romanization system for all scripts, and have them learn a few exceptions for each script

\# 1 sounds painful. Chinese and Japanese had to be typed using mostly visual components for 100 years, and as soon as computers allowed you to type Japanese / Chinese phonetically, almost everyone switched to typing characters phonetically using the latin alphabet. I consider the debate on graphical vs phonetic typing to be settled, with phonetic typing having won.

Even so, typing graphically *sometimes* is unavoidable, since lots of latin script languages use diacritics. Take `p̃` as an example - you may not know how that's pronounced, but vou *do* know that it's a "p" with a tilde above it, and that's exactly how you want to type it.
So we'll make a universal romanization scheme, and map every language's letters to that romanization scheme. That romanization scheme must:
- use only basic latin letters
- no diacritics
- if exceptions are made, they should be easy to guess or learn

I propose:
- 1 romanization system scheme based on the IPA.
- If a language has an empty slot for one of the basic 26 latin letters, then fill that slot with any of the nearest IPA values.

For example, take /gh/ and /g/.
- Arabic has a /gh/ sound but not a /g/ sound.
- Greek has a single letter which can sound like /gh/ or /g/.
Therefore, Arabic and Greek would allow you to simply type /g/.
But in Persian script, there is a separate letter for /g/ and /gh/. So you would have to distinguish the two when you write Persian.

Some languages have letters which are multiple sounds, like latin "x" (ks) and cyrillic я (ja). For these letters, type a combining diacritic "/" which will allow you to type longer strings to match these letters.

For syllabic scripts, the default is to always combine after all vowels have been typed and you have moved onto the next initial consonant.

so as you type k-a-t-a-n-a in Japanese, you will see:
k
→ か
→ かt
→ かた
→ かたｎ
→ かたな
